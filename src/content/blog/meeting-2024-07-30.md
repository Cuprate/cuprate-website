Highlights of the Cuprate meeting of July 30 2024:

## Updates:

- **fluorescent_beige**: "still issue #209, didn't have as much time for it as I thought but getting somewhere now"
- **boog900**: "I have been working on the txpool and planning out what the incoming tx flow will look like".
- **hinto-janai**: "I've mostly finished the RPC interface library, still need to finish testing/documentation + split into PRs"
- **yamabiiko**: "took some time off ahead of CCS,  looking to pick up some issues / expanding tests as suggested"

## What is next:

There has been discussion on work to accomplish by yamabiiko. As well as precedent issues with binary string serialization (for mixed json/epee encoding) and difference
in JSON specifications compliance by monerod serialization library (monerod can accept some invalid JSON, cuprate can't).

- hinto-janai prepared a draft of their next CCS proposal.
- hinto-janai proposed to request core monero to drop out mixed json/epee encoding. Yamabiiko supported the idea.
- Boog900 proposed yamabiiko to work on database after it's alternative block operation PR.
- hinto-janai is planning on making PR on monero-site repository to fix RPC documentation
