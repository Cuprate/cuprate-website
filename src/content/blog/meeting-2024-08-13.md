Highlights of the Cuprate meeting of August 13 2024:

## Updates:

- **fluorescent_beige**: "I'm fixing the massive merge conflicts in my PR for issue #209, probably I'll just make a new branch and redo my changes there. Hope I can wrap it up quickly then"
- **boog900**: "I completed the initial tx-pool PR and have began work on improving the dandelion pool efficiency."
- **hinto-janai**: "no updates, I think I will return from break within a couple days".

## What is next:

There has been discussion about the current RPC handler crates, database and possible change in binary release work.
- Boog proposed to open a bounty for the creation of a rust library capable of interacting with monerod's database. This primary use case would be the creation of two binary focused on serving RPC only. This would enable horizontal scaling and would be quicker to release than cuprated. The initial effort would be lead by boog and hinto
- Moo has spoken.
