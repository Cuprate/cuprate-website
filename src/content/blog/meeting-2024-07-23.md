Highlights of the Cuprate meeting of July 23 2024:

## Updates:

- **boog900**: "I finished the PR adding alt chain handling to the consensus code and have started work on the tx pool".
- **hinto-janai**: "finishing up RPC types, started the RPC interface - only around ~18 days left in my CCS but I'll think I'll be close to finishing on time."

## What is next:

There has been discussion on hinto's remaining work and potential future work to complete. There has also been discussion on balancing
between development time and optimistic release timeline. The actual stance is to work in parallel on several part towards alpha (testnet) release but
first refine the existing codebase and improve testing.

- boog900 plan on reducing the amount of duplicated code between the blockchain and tx-pool. They might formalize a proposal, as suggested by hinto-janai.
