Highlights of the Cuprate meeting of July 2 2024:

## Updates:

- **boog900**: Posted a new CCS proposal and finished the first part of their improvements to the P2P API + other misc things.
- **hinto-janai**: "misc fixes / repo changes, benches/lints stuff, I think I'll be starting the mass RPC type porting today".
- **syntheticbird**: Announced working on cuprate as of tomorrow, starting by catching up missed events.
- **yamabiiko**: Explored monerod's ZMQ codebase and reviewed draft ZMQ proposal.

## What is next:

There has been discussion on current priorities and Tor integration into P2P Code, most notably Arti integration for torless systems.
- ZMQ is still not a priority for testnet release. 
- P2P Code is not mature enough for integrating Tor as of now.
- moo900 has tried to hold hostage participants for a week long meeting.
- Thoughts has been requested on workspace lints to be applied.
